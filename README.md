### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES

Boston University                                      Position: Teaching Assistant in CS 777 Big Data Analytics	01/2021-05/2021 

Ø	In charge of grading assignment, giving office hours for Q&A, assisting professor to improve the quality of course 

Beijing iDataway Technology Co., Ltd                    Position: Internship in Deep learning 	08/2018-12/2018 
Ø	A member of the AI team being responsible for machine learning projects (model constructing and evaluation), big data projects (spark programs), assisting crawler projects providing raw data from websites according to the demand of projects. 
Ø	Contributed to reinstall Hadoop platform on CDH service by Cloudera and established the company’s new cluster server and Utilized the Spark service on Hadoop platform to conduct data cleaning and processing. 

### PROJECTS

News classification system 	09/2020-12/2020 
Ø	An NLP system which automatically classifies categories of news based on its contents. It removes stop words from news titles and abstracts, lemmatizes words to normal form using NLTK, embed words (word vector: word2vec), build TF-IDF matrix as training set, implement Naïve Bayes, simple RNN, LSTM, Bi-Directional LSTM GRU, TextCNN, CNN+RNN models via Keras(Tensorflow). Used dropout and early stopping to  overcome overfitting, 
Ø	Evaluation including cross-validation, comparing precision, recall, and ROC curve.    
Beijing’s hotel price analysis service	09/2018-12/2018 
Ø	Using distributed crawler system Scrapy-redis to collect over 10,000 hotel’s information from Ctrip, Qunar,LY,  three Chinese renowned travel websites.
Ø	Analysis html pages and located API to get JSON packages. Use pandas dataframe to extract hotel price and location information and calculate the mean and standard deviation of prices of certain region and doing research of their trend.In addition, comparing prices of same hotel. This program helped the firm achieve online price contrasting service.
Vehicle License Plate Recognition 	11/2018-12/2018 
Ø	This project is based on optimized HyperLPR model.
Ø	Using Haar-like to do the feature detection , located license plate area via AdaBoost cascade classifier and intercept this part of image, identify car plate characters via RCNN model. The  difficult part of this project is locating the precise are of car plate, the results shows that  RCNN has a high accuracy in identifying characters but when it comes locating complex plates, like two lines plates ,it shows a not so good performance.
Face Recognition System (Graduation Project with grade A) 	01/2018-05/2018 
Ø	This system uses optimized version of Alex Net, by adding convolution layer, BatchNormalization and Dropout layer, changing optimizer to Adam and Rmsprop, developed via TensorFlow framework and trained by open source face training set.     
Ø	The overall system architecture was SSH(Struts, Spring, Hibernate) framework that acquired human images from website, sent them to back end and those face information will be compared with face images in  database and then returns a list of similarity of candidates, as the result of CNN is vector, so here it uses Cos() function to calculate similarities. Normally, it will take the candidate with 1st similarity as the result.
